# Socketme

A very basic practice project to start befriending WebSockets (particularly, Socket.io).

## How to use

In its present stage (omega, because it's not even alpha :) ), should you want to give a dry run with this, you just simply have to:

1. Clone this repo locally

2. Make sure you have Node.js installed (tested with v18)

3. Run `npm i` to install all deps

4. Position yourself in the root directory of the project (`cd <folder>`)

5. Run `node io` (or `npm run start` if you are going to work on the code, too, since it enables nodemon to watch for changes).

6. Open a couple of browser tabs on `localhost:3000` and play around sending and receiving messages. :)

7. Optionally (give me feedback about what I can improve)
